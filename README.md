# About this project
I'm developing this project for both continuous learning and to improve my Java skills.
It has codes, scripts, algorithms, challenges, exercises, annotations, comments, and
more that I developed during this saga.

### [Kata] "Sort and Star" from CodeWars :white_check_mark:
The description [this challenge](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57cfdf34902f6ba3d300001e/train/java) is:
You will be given a vector of strings. You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive, and based on the ASCII values of the chars)
and then return the first value.
The returned value must be a string, and have "***" between each of its letters.

Examples:
```text
  SortAndStar.do(new String[] {"bitcoin", "take", "over", "the", "world", "maybe", "who", "knows", "perhaps"}) // should return "b***i***t***c***o***i***n"
  SortAndStar.do(new String[] "turns", "out", "random", "test", "cases", "are", "easier", "than", "writing", "out", "basic", "ones"}) // should return "a***r***e"
```
